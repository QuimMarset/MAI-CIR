Of course, more types of games and tests would be great and maybe illustrations and animations could be more approachable and charming for certain range of ages, felt a little bit distracted with the person executing the gestures."

It is a very good idea and it is easy to learn and it keeps you motivated and confident. The app is very easy to use, intuitive and user-friendly."

However perhaps there could be some information in the particularities of the signs, since for deaf people it is very important the placement of the fingers to understand the message, and us hearing people don't give it the importance required (however, the AI might). Some signs are not well differenced, such as i-d, or drink (in my case). I would enjoy that the application included a brief introduction to the ASL language clarifying that the signs we learned are only useful for the american sign language and it is not worldwide knowledge."
